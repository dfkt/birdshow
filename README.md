A simple random fullscreen slideshow, reading images directly from the file system. No client-side caching, no input lists, no nonsense. Suitable for gigantic collections of images, unlike client-side-only JS solutions.

The demo site reads from a pool of ca. 50000 images: https://birdshow.dfkt.tk/
